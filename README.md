## what we do ?
Our Product Green Grid is a service which makes an AI based predictive analysis model and 
uses it to predict the load generated on the grid due to the various EV chargers across the country.

---
## AIM
Our main aim is to use the electricity consumption data of EV chargers available publically on the internet.
---
## Result
Using this consumption data we can predict, When and where the grid will experience an electricity demand load.
---
## Advantage
Early prediction of grid load will enable us to pre-inform the authorities and enable better routing of resources and early risk assessment.
